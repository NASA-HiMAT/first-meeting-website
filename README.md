# first-meeting-website

This is an old template of the website used to manage the first NASA High Mountain Asia team meeting, Nov 2016 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. We used a Jekyll web template borrowed from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). Since that time we have hosted similar content directly on the team website (using WordPress).
