# Pre-Work:

All PI Teams are required to provide the following to Anthony prior to the workshop:

1. Top 3 papers most closely related to your team's efforts:
   - helps us build a shared [bibliography](http://aaarendt.github.io/himat/2016/11/22/meeting.html#)
   - facilitate knowledge sharing across the team
2. <a href="{{ page.root }}/design/">Science Traceability Matrix (STM)</a>: science questions, data needs and data assets:
  - each PI team is to map out their own STM. We will then combine and use to assess overall HiMAT science goals. 
3. List of core capabilities & skills of team members:
  - enables people to discover who has answers to questions as they arise
  - will be used to further populate [HiMAT interactive diagram](http://35.160.91.70/himat_d3/) by discipline, skill rather than just institution
4. (optional) Data files related to any analysis completed on the initial target region (Indus Basin)

    * a toolkit to inform regional decision making
    * a calibration/validation/reanalysis framework for integrating data and models
  * [1-2-4-All](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) to generate ideas & determine viability
