# Day 1:

### Welcome & Introductions :: 20 mins

* Tom
* Anthony
* Goddard official welcome

### Agenda, goals & objectives for workshop :: 15 mins

* Anthony and design team
   * Purpose of the workshop
   * Convey structure and flow of the agenda - what to expect 
   * What we hope and believe the workshop will make possible 
   * What we want to leave with 
   * What we expect from everyone in order to make the workshop interactions successful

### Connecting to other participants :: 20 mins 

* build connections across the team

### Where are we starting? :: 45 mins

* Interview & presentation by Anthony (and Tom?)
  * Explore leadership approach and mechanisms for the coordination effort 
  * What _must_ we achieve? What are the metrics of success for HiMAT?
  * Explore what we mean when discussing integration, collaboration and autonomy
  * Discuss strategy questions and conceptual maps of the overall effort 
  * What is GMELT?
  * Present Science Traceability Matrix draft for HiMAT

### Who we are and what we are doing :: 4.5 hours

* 4 Lightning talks :: 10 mins/talk
* Feedback cards and collaboration notes after each :: 5 mins/talk
* Spotlight discussion :: 20 min
   * Foster understanding about an area of the science or data challenge by hearing from a small group of people with direct experience discuss the topic between them 
* Group discussion and sensemaking :: 10 mins
<br><br>
* REPEAT the above series of lightning talks + feedback + group discussion 3 times for the 12 PI teams
<br><br>
* Sensemaking with project teams :: 30 mins
   * Review feedback cards
   * Look at notes on other teams
   * Determine follow-up steps and what other teams needs to be responded to
* Trading places :: 30 mins
   * Spend time to coordinate and follow-up with other teams & individuals as needed

### Debrief & closing :: 15 mins

# Day 2:

### Connecting & welcoming :: 20 mins
   * Reconnecting with each other and lifting-off from where we left-off
   * Agenda review & goals for day

### Integration ideation :: 90 mins
  * Given the HMA science questions before us, what are your boldest, most ambitious ideas for integrating our scientific activities? This might look like a tangible and practically useful toolkit to inform regional decision making; a calibration/validation/reanalysis framework for integrating data and models; a coordinated improvement of mesoscale climate or hydrological simulation models. 
  * Presentation of two potential starting points: Sujay’s LIS; Anthony’s GRACE forward modeling
  * [1-2-4-All](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) to generate ideas & determine viability
  * Present ideas to full group
  * Evaluate the range of ideas on desirability and feasibility (based on the complexity of integrating your own project into the more integrated idea)

### Collaboration principles & failure states :: 60 mins
  * Identify the activities, behaviours, anything that could derail our efforts together. What must we avoid at all costs moving forward?
  * What are the agreements about using other people’s data and model outputs?

### Assorted topics :: 4.5 hours
  * Full group discussions and deliberation
     * coordinating our engagement with ICIMOD and international partners (Dalia)
     * NASA ADAPT technology demonstration and sign-up (Batu)
    * Accessing DigitalGlobe imagery (Shean)
* Small group discussions & breakouts with reporting template
   * Model atlas
   * Data atlas
   * Assigned working groups
   * Open space with reporting template
* Self-organized sessions around lingering topics & needs
* Report out and debrief of small group & open space discussions
* What happened and what did we learn? So what, why is this important? Now what? What are our next steps?
* Prioritization for Day 3
* Lingering issues still needing to be addressed

### Closing :: 15 mins
   * Anthony & NASA check-in

  * Open space topics
  * Work group coordination & action planning

### Action planning & tidying up :: 40 mins
  * Use graphic templates if necessary
  * Preparing to lift-off where the workshop is leaving off
  * Provide individual teams with time to coordinate their own independent actions and solidify collaboration opportunities

### Closing options :: 20 mins
  * Spotlight discussion about the entire workshop 
  * What was the value of getting together?
