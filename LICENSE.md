# Pre-Work:

All PI Teams are required to provide the following to Anthony prior to the workshop:

1. List of core capabilities & skills of team members:
  - enables people to discover who has answers to questions as they arise
  - will be used to further populate [HiMAT interactive diagram](http://staff.washington.edu/landungs/himat_d3/#) by discipline, skill rather than just institution
2. <a href="{{ page.root }}/design/">Science Traceability Matrix (STM)</a>: science questions, data needs and data assets:
  - each PI team is to map out their own STM. We will then combine and use to assess overall HiMAT science goals. 
3. Top 3 papers most closely related to your team's efforts:
   - helps us build a shared [bibliography](https://github.com/aaarendt/HiMAT/blob/master/Bibliography/HiMAT.pdf)
   - facilitate knowledge sharing across the team
4. (optional) Data files related to any analysis completed on the initial target region (Indus Basin)

# Day 1:

### Welcome & Introductions :: 20 mins

* Tom
* Anthony
* Goddard official welcome

### Agenda, goals & objectives for workshop :: 15 mins

* Anthony and design team:
   * Purpose of the workshop
   * Convey structure and flow of the agenda 
   * What we believe the workshop will make possible 
   * What we want to leave with 
   * What we expect from everyone in order to make the workshop interactions successful
   * How we will link our activites to advancing the science in the region

### Connecting to other participants :: 20 mins 

* [build connections](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/) across the team

### Where are we starting? :: 45 mins

* [Interview](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/5-appreciative-interviews-ai/) & presentation by Anthony (and Tom?)
  * Explore leadership approach and mechanisms for the coordination effort 
  * What _must_ we achieve? What are the metrics of success for HiMAT?
  * Explore what we mean when discussing integration, collaboration and autonomy
  * Discuss strategy questions and conceptual maps of the overall effort 
  * What is GMELT?
  * What is the leadership's view of most important science objectives? 
  * Present Science Traceability Matrix draft for HiMAT
  * (optional) How does our upcoming engagement with China impact HiMAT activities and planning?

### Who we are and what we are doing :: 4.5 hours

* 4 <a href="{{ page.root }}/customization/">Lightning talks</a> :: 10 mins/talk
* Feedback cards and collaboration notes after each :: 5 mins/talk
* Spotlight discussion :: 20 min
   * Foster understanding about an area of the science or data challenge by hearing from a small group of people with direct experience discuss the topic between them 
* Group discussion and sensemaking :: 10 mins
<br><br>
* REPEAT the above series of lightning talks + feedback + group discussion 3 times for the 12 PI teams
<br><br>
* Sensemaking with project teams :: 30 mins
   * Review feedback cards
   * Look at notes on other teams
   * Determine follow-up steps and what other teams needs to be responded to
* Trading places :: 30 mins
   * Spend time to coordinate and follow-up with other teams & individuals as needed

### Debrief & closing :: 15 mins
   * Anthony to close Day 1
   * Report out or responses from NASA leadership team

<hr>

# Day 2:

### Connecting & welcoming :: 20 mins
   * Reconnecting with each other and lifting-off from where we left-off
   * Agenda review & goals for day

### Integration ideation :: 90 mins
  * Given the HMA science questions before us, what are your boldest, most ambitious ideas for integrating our scientific activities? This might look like:
    * a coordinated improvement of key datasets fundamental to all investigations in the region
    * a toolkit to inform regional decision making
    * a calibration/validation/reanalysis framework for integrating data and models
  * (optional, for discussion) Presentation of two potential starting points, building on existing integration frameworks:
     * NASA Land Information System (Sujay)
     * GRACE forward modeling (Anthony)
  * [1-2-4-All](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) to generate ideas & determine viability
  * Present ideas to full group
  * Evaluate the range of ideas on desirability and feasibility (based on the complexity of integrating your own project into the more integrated idea)

### Collaboration principles and failure states :: 60 mins
  * Identify the activities, behaviors, anything that could derail our efforts together. What must we avoid at all costs moving forward?
  * What are the agreements about using other people’s data and model outputs?

### Assorted topics :: 4.5 hours
  * Full group discussions and deliberation
     * coordinating our engagement with ICIMOD and international partners (Dalia, Nancy)
     * NASA ADAPT technology demonstration and sign-up (Batu, Goddard IT)
     * Accessing DigitalGlobe imagery (Shean)
* Small group discussions & breakouts with reporting template
   * <a href="{{ page.root }}/faq/">Model atlas</a>
   * <a href="{{ page.root }}/faq/">Data atlas</a>
   * Exploration of datasets / open hacking related to initial simulations for Indus Basin 
* Self-organized sessions around lingering topics & needs
* Report out and debrief of small group & open space discussions
* What happened and what did we learn? So what, why is this important? Now what? What are our next steps?
* Prioritization for Day 3
* Lingering issues still needing to be addressed

### Closing :: 15 mins
   * Anthony & NASA check-in

# Day 3:

### Introduction & priorities :: 10 mins

  * Goals for today
  * Agenda review

### Connecting :: 15 mins
  * Continue making loose connections across project teams

### HiMAT STM Check-in and review :: 60 mins

  * Open space topics
  * Work group coordination & action planning

### Action planning & tidying up :: 40 mins
