### Purpose

The purpose of the lightning talks is for each PI team to describe their proposed work within HiMAT. Each team does not yet have clarity on what the others are doing which is a barrier to collaboration.

### Format
 
* each PI team will have 10 minutes to present
* the PI or someone else representing the group can be the presenter
* audience members will be filling out cards with specific notes on data they can provide, data or model output they could use, opportunities for collaboration. Group discussions will focus around these notes to maximize opportunities for exchanges.

### Content 

* begin with an overview of the key science questions to be addressed
* focus on physical or socioeconomic _processes_: what is known, what are the gaps in knowledge
* how will your team address the gaps and move the science forward?
* provide a brief overview of how you will conduct the science:
   * identify data/model needs and assets at a high level: there will be opportunity to fill in detail when we build the atlases
   * focus on novel approaches especially if other team members may not have heard about this (e.g. machine learning)
* if cross-team collaboration is already occuring, describe it; if not, identify what opportunities your team sees for collaboration
