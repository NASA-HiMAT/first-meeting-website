_More detail to come here. Sarah has a draft spreadsheet already started. We will begin asking specific people to fill in their model details to get this completed by the meeting._

### Purpose: 

* to compile a comprehensive list of all models that will be employed in the HiMAT investigations
* to ensure clear communication between people with data, people needing model output, and the modeling groups
* to coordinate sharing of results and to minimize duplication of effort
* to build a community of practice around modeling approaches

### Contents:

* initial conditions, boundary conditions, parameters, driving datasets, variables that can be generated for output, range of possible spatial and temporal resolutions, compute times, compute needs (if relevant), algorithmic development in progress, known algorithmic deficiencies, target users
