title: Model Atlas
permalink: /faq/
---

### Purpose: 

* to compile a comprehensive list of all models that will be employed in the HiMAT investigations
* to ensure clear communication between people with data, people needing model output, and the modeling groups
* to coordinate sharing of results and to minimize duplication of effort
* to build a community of practice around modeling approaches
* to document model setup, boundary conditions, and other pertinent information for data creation

### Contents:

* initial conditions, boundary conditions, parameters, driving datasets, variables that can be generated for output, range of possible spatial and temporal resolutions, compute times, compute needs (if relevant), algorithmic development in progress, known algorithmic deficiencies, target users, radiative forcing, data format, spatial coverage (latitudinal / longitudinal range or other geographic description)


### Draft atlas:
