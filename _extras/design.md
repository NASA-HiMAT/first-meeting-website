_The idea is for each team to map out their STM, providing a mechanism for rapid sharing of overall goals, data needs and assets. Below is an example for Anthony's team. I'd like this to map to an overall HiMAT STM by the end of the workshop. Goal is to draft the overall STM with PIs prior to the meeting._


## NASA Earth System Science:

To develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.

## NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT):

* __Objective #1__: To determine the physical processes driving changes in water resources in the HMA region.
* __Objective #2__: To predict impacts of changing HMA water resources on human and biogeophysical systems.  

| Science Objectives | Approach | Data Needed  | Data/output generated | Expected Outcomes |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| To quantify the mass variations of the entire HMA region with a focus on isolating mass changes due to hydrology and cryosphere. | Forward modeling of GRACE Level 1B data together with all available observed/modeled hydrological information. | Best estimates of cryosphere and hydrology variations in the region along with associated uncertainties, up to daily resolution, up to 1 km spatial.	| Residuals of mass not currently captured by existing cryosphere/hydrology observations and models @ 1x1 degree mascon spatial and monthly temporal resolution across entire HMA.	| Information on deficiencies in existing models /datasets; Formal mechanism for using GRACE to validate model output; iterative procedure can be implemented. |
| To assess the status of glacier mass balance in the HMA region.	| Generation of high resolution DEMs from DigitalGlobe archive using the Ames Stereo Pipeline.	| Imagery from NGA via Paul Morin | 1 m imagery; 4 / 8 / 12 m resolution DEMs; DEM difference maps where data available | New capacity to map features at very high resolution (lakes, debris cover, landslides, etc); cal/val for glacier mass balance models |
