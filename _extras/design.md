## NASA Earth System Science:

To develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.

## NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT):

* __Objective #1__: To determine the physical processes driving changes in water resources in the HMA region.
* __Objective #2__: To predict impacts of changing HMA water resources on human and biogeophysical systems.  

| Science Objectives | Approach | Data Needed  | Data/output generated | Expected Outcomes |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| To quantify the mass variations of the entire HMA region with a focus on isolating mass changes due to hydrology and cryosphere. | Forward modeling of GRACE Level 1B data together with all available observed/modeled hydrological information. | Best estimates of cryosphere and hydrology variations in the region along with associated uncertainties, up to daily resolution, up to 1 km spatial.	| Residuals of mass not currently captured by existing cryosphere/hydrology observations and models @ 1x1 degree mascon spatial and monthly temporal resolution across entire HMA.	| Information on deficiencies in existing models /datasets; Formal mechanism for using GRACE to validate model output; iterative procedure can be implemented. |
| To assess HMA glacier mass balance on ~50-year, decadal, annual and seasonal timescales.	| Generate high-resolution DEMs from DigitalGlobe imagery and integrate with other available DEMs for elevation change analysis.|<ul><li>DigitalGlobe imagery from Polar Geospatial Center (Morin, Osmanoglu/Montesano/Neigh)</li><li> SNODAS snowcover data for DEM co-registration (Painter) </li><li>Historical DEMs from declassified ~1970s imagery (Rupper/Maurer)</li><li> SRTM, ICESat-1, ICESat-2</li></ul> | <ul><li>item1</li><li>item2</li></ul>|  New capacity to map features at very high resolution (lakes, debris cover, landslides, etc); cal/val for glacier mass balance models |
