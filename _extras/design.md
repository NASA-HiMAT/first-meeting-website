# NASA Earth System Science

To develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.

## NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT)

* __Objective #1__: To determine the physical processes driving changes in water resources in the HMA region.
* __Objective #2__: To predict impacts of changing HMA water resources on human and biogeophysical systems.
