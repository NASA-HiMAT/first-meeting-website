# NASA Earth System Science

To develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.

## NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT)

* __Objective #1__: To determine the physical processes driving changes in water resources in the HMA region.
* __Objective #2__: To predict impacts of changing HMA water resources on human and biogeophysical systems.

 Validating a Glacier Melt Toolbox For High Mountain Asia Using a Remote-Sensing-Driven Data Integration Framework

| Science Objectives | Approach | Data Needed  | Data/output generated | Expected Outcomes |
|:-------------|:----------------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| To quantify the mass variations of the entire HMA region with a focus on isolating mass changes due to hydrology and cryosphere. | Forward modeling of GRACE Level 1B data together with all available observed/modeled hydrological information. | Best estimates of cryosphere and hydrology variations in the region along with associated uncertainties, up to daily resolution, up to 1 km spatial.	| Residuals of mass not currently captured by existing cryosphere/hydrology observations and models @ 1x1 degree mascon spatial and monthly temporal resolution across entire HMA.	| Information on deficiencies in existing models /datasets; Formal mechanism for using GRACE to validate model output; iterative procedure can be implemented. |
| To assess HMA glacier mass balance on ~50-year, decadal, annual and seasonal timescales.	| Generate high-resolution DEMs from DigitalGlobe imagery and integrate with other available DEMs for elevation change analysis.|<ul><li>DigitalGlobe imagery from Polar Geospatial Center (Morin, Osmanoglu/Montesano/Neigh)</li><li> SNODAS snowcover data for DEM co-registration (Painter) </li><li>Historical DEMs from declassified ~1970s imagery (Rupper/Maurer)</li><li> SRTM, ICESat-1, ICESat-2</li></ul> | <ul><li>2, 8, 32-m DEMs</li><li>0.5-m orthoimages</li><li>DEM time series and regional mosaics</li><li>Volume/mass change estimates</li></ul>|  <ul><li>Regional glacier mass balance estimates</li><li>Cal/val for GMELT models</li><li>New capacity for high-resolution geomorphological analyses (lakes, debris cover, landslides, etc)</li></ul>| 
| To quantify groundwater contributions to terrestrial water storage change in HMA| Collect and analyze available groundwater observations and conduct baseflow recession analysis from available stream gauges | Observation wells and longterm streamflow records, ideally a few points within major sub-basins | Monthly groundwater storage changes (spatial resolution partially dependent on data availability) | Improved groundwater data to contribute to GRACE forward modeling efforts | 
| To assess downstream impacts of changing water availability as a function of cryospheric change, especially in agricultural systems | <ul><li>Estimate current water demand for downstream water uses and differentiate between groundwater and surface water sources</li><li>Develop future demand scenarios and assess impacts of changing surface availability from snow/glacial melt on scenarios</li><li>crop modeling to assess agricultural management strategies</li></ul> | Projections of changes in streamflow, landcover maps, population projects, historical crop yields (if doing crop modeling) | Maps of land use scenarios as a function of changes in water availability | <ul><li>mechanism to translate the impacts of scientific findings to societal applications</li><li>improved understanding of future water availability, and the changing dependence between surface water and groundwater</li></ul> |
