_More detail to come. Bruce has a template already and will lead this effort. Anthony's team has started making maps of available data and we can at least post static maps, possibly a simple geoserver dynamic map._

### Purpose:

* the models we run are meaningless unless we calibrate them with field data. Access to observations is a core element of our ability to run hydrological models in the region.
* we will soon be working more closely with our Chinese colleagues, and data will be an early topic of discussion

### Contents

* a list of all available in situ observations in the region: what is available, how do we access it, provide as much metadata as possible (accuracy, usage constraints, etc).
