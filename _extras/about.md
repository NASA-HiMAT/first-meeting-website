# Data Atlas

### Purpose:

* the models we run are meaningless unless we calibrate them with field data. Access to observations is a core element of our ability to run hydrological models in the region.
* we will soon be working more closely with our Chinese colleagues, and data will be an early topic of discussion

### Contents

* a list of all available in situ observations in the region: what is available, how do we access it, provide as much metadata as possible (accuracy, usage constraints, etc). 

More to come here...Bruce has a template already and will lead. Anthony's team has started making maps of available data.
