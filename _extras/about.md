### Purpose:

* the models we run are meaningless unless we calibrate them with field data. Access to observations is a core element of our ability to run hydrological models in the region.
* we will soon be working more closely with our Chinese colleagues, and data will be an early topic of discussion

### Contents:

* a list of all available in situ observations in the region: what is available, how do we access it, provide as much metadata as possible (accuracy, usage constraints, etc). 

### Preliminary geoserver tools:

* visit our draft [web map service](http://35.160.91.70/webmap/)
* look at this [link to datasets](http://35.160.91.70:8080/geoserver/web/wicket/bookmarkable/org.geoserver.web.demo.MapPreviewPage?1)
